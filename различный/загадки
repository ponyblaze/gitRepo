In the middle of a Forrest there is a cabin
In the cabin is a chair
in the chair is a man.
The man is dead.
How did he die?

When you have 3, you have 3.
When you have 2, you have 2.
When you have 1, you have none.

Walk on the living, they don't even mumble. Walk on the dead, they mutter and grumble. What are they?
